Oh joyous day, when one may immerse
In waters pure and crystal clear.
To wash away the grime and dirt,
And leave the body fresh and sheer.

The Minecraft world doth offer up
A wealth of streams and rivers fair.
But lo, a bath of one's design
Is where true luxury lies there.

The joy of soaking in warm suds,
Of feeling water's gentle touch,
Of letting go the day's fatigue
And feeling one's whole being flush.

A time to contemplate and muse,
Or sing a tune or two aloud,
Or simply float and drift away,
In peaceful silence, free and proud.

So let us revel in this gift,
Of Minecraft baths, so fine and rare.
And bask in all their cleansing bliss,
With not a worry nor a care.
